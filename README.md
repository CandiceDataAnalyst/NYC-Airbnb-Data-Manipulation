## 1. Importing the Data

<br>
Welcome to New York City (NYC), one of the most-visited cities in the world. 
As a result, there are many <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/"><em>Airbnb</em></a> listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for anywhere between a few nights to many months. 
In this notebook, we will take a look at the NYC Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like <code>.csv</code>, <code>.tsv</code>, and <code>.xlsx</code>.</p>
<p><br><br>
We will be working with three datasets:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>"datasets/airbnb_price.csv"</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>"datasets/airbnb_room_type.xlsx"</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>"datasets/airbnb_last_review.tsv"</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p><br><br>
Our goals are to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC? </li>
<li>How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market? </li>
<li>How many adverts are for private rooms? </li>
<li>How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?</li>
</ul>
